# What does Naive Bayes know about (Bumble) dating reviews? - NLP
- I explored 2000 Bumble dating reviews on the Apple app store in this project. I wanted to make a model that could determine whether a review was good or bad (here I decided that a good review was 4 or more). I also wanted to see which words occurred the most for different ratings.
- So I started by doing some exploratory data analysis using Python libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas and NumPy.
